# mmb-clicker

**mmb-clicker** is a Blender add-on that allows you to switch the interaction mode with a double-click of the middle mouse button (MMB). It also provides quick object switching and viewport navigation—faster than searching for the Tab key or a dropdown menu.

## Features

- **Mode Switching:**  
  Change interaction modes with a MMB double-click.
  
- **Object Select:**  
  Edit other object in same mode.
  
- **Viewport Navigation:**  
  Move the viewport by clicking, releasing, then clicking and holding the MMB (similar to using Shift + MMB).
  
- **Mouse:**  
  Best used with a "clicking scroll wheel."

## How It Works

1. **Switching Modes On Objects:**  
   Hover over an object and double-click the MMB. The add-on will cycle Blender's interaction mode based on the object type:
   
   - **Curve:** Toggles between `EDIT` and `OBJECT` mode.
   - **Mesh (without an armature modifier with armature set):** Toggles between `EDIT` and `OBJECT` mode.
   - **Mesh:** Toggles between `EDIT` and `WEIGHT_PAINT` mode.
   - **Armature:** Toggles between `POSE` and `EDIT` mode.
   
   **Note for Sculpting Workspace:**  
   If your current workspace is named **"Sculpting"**, a Mesh will switch between `SCULPTING` and `EDIT` modes instead.

2. **Switching Modes On Empty Space:**  
   Double-click the MMB while the mouse cursor is over empty space to switch to `OBJECT` mode.

3. **Viewport Navigation:**  
   To move the 3D view, quickly perform this sequence:
   - **Click** the MMB and immediately **release**.
   - Then **click and hold** the MMB before dragging your mouse.
   
## Limitations

- **Orthographic Mode Flicker:**  
  When in orthographic mode, these actions may cause a brief flicker as Blender temporarily switches to perspective mode. Known issue, probably no solution.
